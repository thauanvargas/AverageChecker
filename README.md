# MarketUtils
MarketUtils is a extension to check Average of a Item in the room, or in Trades, soon will allow players to find in the room the item they are searching for.

# Features
- Double Click a Furniture in the room to check it's average value in market
- Check Average of each item in trades

# Known Issues
- Maybe wall items on trades, aren't with correct values right now
- Doesn't check wallitems on double click
- I didn't do a check to know if you can be banned by spamming the check average on MarketPlace so no feature was done to avoid if this happens (use at own risk)

# How to use
--- Trading Average
1. Click Enable on Trade to check trading items average when you start trading
2. Start a Trade and put a item, or wait for the other player to put a item.
3. You'll receive a message with each Item average!
--- Double click furni 
1. Click Enable Double Click
2. Double Click a Item in the room
3. You'll receive a message with each Item average!

# TODO:
- Add a feature to check if a item you are looking for is in the current room!
